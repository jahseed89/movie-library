This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

####### This application is developed using the Next.js App Router and integrates with the TMDb API to dynamically retrieve and display trending movies on the homepage.
####### The project is built using TypeScript for robust development and Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling. 
####### Users can access a dashboard showcasing all trending movies, with each movie card providing a navigable link to detailed information about the selected movie.

#####   Applicatoon is run with the: npm run dev command.


##### NOTE: Currently, the MovieDetails page is not functioning as expected, but I am actively working on resolving the issue. I had to submit the project before the deadline. Additionally, I am implementing further improvements to enhance the application's overall quality.
